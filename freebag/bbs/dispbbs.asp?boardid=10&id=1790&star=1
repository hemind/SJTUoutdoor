Should we fall off, like spiders our body harnesses may instantly attach safety lines to the rock. If and when inventors develop this technology, we will no doubt consider it clever . . . but obvious - thanks to our 20-20 hindsight. But for now, none of us can envision the details. </P><P>And so it was with the Friends 25 years ago when I was inventing them. The need was apparent, at least to me, but the actual configuration was elusive to everyone. </P><P>Seeking a devise that would anchor itself in a crack, and hold with greater power the harder the pull, I began the inventive process in 1971 with a dual sliding wedge design. Taking advantage of my aerospace engineering background I analyzed this configuration and found it mathematically unsound. The internal friction between any kind of wedges reduce their holding power, and in many situations such a device could pull out. I was inventing for my own use, and was not about to compromise safety. </P><P>The summer of 1973 Mike Lowe tried to sell me a few of his new Cam Nuts, which he said his brother Greg had invented. They worked, he explained, on the principle of the constant angle cam. Intuitively I saw that the concept was viable, and felt that here might be the idea I had been looking for. I bought three of them. Unfortunately the first time I used them all three flipped out and went sliding down the rope into my belayer's arms, leaving me running out a 5.9 fist crack unprotected. That was also the last time I used them.</P><P><BR><br><IMG SRC="pic/gif.gif" border=0>此主题相关图片如下：<br><A HREF="uploadImages/200432323422841515.gif" TARGET=_blank><IMG SRC="uploadImages/200432323422841515.gif" border=0 alt=按此在新窗口浏览图片 onload="javascript:if(this.width>screen.width-333)this.width=screen.width-333"></A>← Greg Lowe's orignial design --- Anchordevice for mountain climbers</P><P>The constant angle spiral is ubiquitous in Nature, from seashells and pinecones to swirling barometric pressure gradients and the great spiral nebulas. Really, it is just an expression of uniform growth. Descartes described the principle mathematically in 1638, calling it the equiangular spiral. Since then, constant angle cams have been used in uncountable mechanical devices. I don't know where Greg got his idea of applying the concept to a crack anchoring device. Perhaps it was from the Jumar ascender, which uses a more-or-less constant angle cam to clinch the rope. At any rate we have Greg to thank for introducing the concept to crack anchoring technology. </P><P>Configuring a workable device, however, proved to be an enormous task. In retrospect it took someone with aerospace engineering skills, a questing mind coupled with extreme motivation and a passion for climbing - something of a rare combination perhaps. For months I worked in Bill Forrest's machine shop building camming prototypes, testing them at the local crags and innovating design improvements in the evenings at home. In the end I filled a couple of sizable boxes with discarded prototypes.</P><P>Many of these designs were later backwards engineered on the basis of Friends by other companies, and are in production today. This despite the fact that I found them wanting from the beginning, and discarded them. For after all, I did not have to compete with myself, and therefore I had the luxury of moving beyond inferior designs.</P><P>Then one day after trying absolutely everything I could think of, and continually straining my mind for ever more ideas, the Creator enlightened me with the concept of a double set of opposing and independently spring loaded cams. Like wheels of a car having independent suspension, each of these cams would be able to adjust to widely varying surface irregularities, within limits of course. I put one of these "quads" together and took it to the crags for testing. The cams were spring loaded against each-other, and they were held together with a high-tensile steel bolt. But the bolt was wrapped with a piece of ordinary strap iron as a stem, and of course the device lacked any kind of trigger. On a 5.8 route which I called Fantasia, located at Split Rocks, I climbed to a stance where I could almost let go with both hands, and managed to squiggle the Quad into a hand-sized crack. By the way it behaved I knew instantly that it was the solution to the problem I had been working on all that time. </P><P><BR><br><IMG SRC="pic/jpg.gif" border=0>此主题相关图片如下：<br><A HREF="uploadImages/200432323434957540.jpg" TARGET=_blank><IMG SRC="uploadImages/200432323434957540.jpg" border=0 alt=按此在新窗口浏览图片 onload="javascript:if(this.width>screen.width-333)this.width=screen.width-333"></A>←Friend P1-1, photo R.J.<BR>This is Friend #1, my first functioning model built in the late fall of 1973. It was the product of months of prototyping literally hundreds of other ideas that ultimately led me to this. It had no trigger, and the stem was completely make-shift, just enough to allow testing of the independent-quad concept. This unit went up only one climb, Fantasia at Split Rocks, west of Lyons, CO.</P><P>The following spring, 1974, I took my first set of working prototype Friends to Yosemite and climbed dozens of difficult routes with them. These units were rough hewn and extremely limited by today's standards, and I had only a few 2-1/2s and 3-1/2's. But they certainly proved their worth, and at season's end three of us used them in an attempt to climb the Nose in a day. Three hours of downpour late that afternoon immobilized us beneath the Great Roof and forced a bivy at Camp V. But we did finish in 28 hours total climbing time, and managed to cut the previous three-day record in half.</P><P><BR><br><IMG SRC="pic/jpg.gif" border=0>此主题相关图片如下：<br><A HREF="uploadImages/200432323444021388.jpg" TARGET=_blank><IMG SRC="uploadImages/200432323444021388.jpg" border=0 alt=按此在新窗口浏览图片 onload="javascript:if(this.width>screen.width-333)this.width=screen.width-333"></A>←Friend P2-2.5, photo R.J.<BR>This is my first working prototype. In size it is equivalent to today's 2-1/2. I made three of these, and two size 3-1/2. And used them the full Spring climbing season 1974, culminating with an ascent of the Nose with Lou Dawson and Kris Walker, in 1.5 days, or 20 hours total climbing time. Previous record was 3 days. </P><P>For the next six years I continued making improved prototypes. My focus was not in their commercial application, but on the literally thousands of routes I used them on, mostly in Yosemite. My partners were limited in number and "sworn to secrecy" because I felt a little paranoid about the idea being ripped off by some manufacturer. Meanwhile, I certainly did give the Lowe brothers plenty of time to introduce workable camming devices of their own invention, which they did not. </P><P>In 1977 Mark Vallance invited me to the UK to help him start manufacturing Friends. Mark is a highly dedicated and gifted individual, and was the first person to foresee the widespread appeal of Friends. Friend marketability is obvious now, but it certainly was not then, and Mark was the visionary who made it happen. The next year Mark founded Wild Country and started selling Friends. </P><P><BR><br><IMG SRC="pic/jpg.gif" border=0>此主题相关图片如下：<br><A HREF="uploadImages/200432323453292457.jpg" TARGET=_blank><IMG SRC="uploadImages/200432323453292457.jpg" border=0 alt=按此在新窗口浏览图片 onload="javascript:if(this.width>screen.width-333)this.width=screen.width-333"></A>←Friends, photo R.J.<BR>This are the later generation prototypes that I used for most of my Yosemite climbing from 1975 to 1978 when the production units went on sale. I had five sets of each size. </P><P>What do I think of today's preponderance of Friend look-alikes and so-called improvements? First, I feel that a certain amount of it is blatantly inferior. In the same vein that people would not go to quacks for brain surgery, climbers would be unwise to entrust their lives to cheap Friend imitations made of inferior materials. If you have something like this on your rack, you might consider getting rid of it. Secondly, there are all sorts of gizmos out there which, in my mind at least, are theoretically unsound. Three cam units are one example. Analogously, three wheeled vehicles were banned from the marketplace years ago because of their inherent instability. Many other gizmos out there are mathematically unsafe, and I certainly would not bet my life on them! Thirdly, there are a number of so-called improvements which in reality are nothing but patent work-arounds. I suspect that they will fade from vogue over time - meanwhile we might be aware of the hype. And lastly, now that the Friend patents are expiring we are seeing virtual-copies by major manufacturers. I believe in higher laws, which is the main reason why I recommend only the genuine articles - Friends.
